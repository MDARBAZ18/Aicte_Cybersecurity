# Steganography using Python (cv2)
```bash ✨ Project Description
This project securely hides a secret message inside an image using pixel value manipulation.
It ensures that only users with the correct passcode can decrypt and retrieve the hidden message.
The encryption does not cause any visible change to the image, maintaining secrecy.

bash # 🚀 Features
Hide a custom secret message inside an image.

Protect the message with a passcode.

Decrypt only if the correct passcode is entered.

Minimal visual distortion to the image.

Simple, lightweight, and fast.

bash # 🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x installed

Required Python library:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python
📂 Project Structure

├── stego.py          # Main Python script
├── mypic.jpg         # Image file (used for embedding message)
└── README.md         # (This file)
⚙️ Setup Instructions
Clone or download the project folder.

Place your image (mypic.jpg) inside the project folder.

bash Install OpenCV library if not already installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python stego.py
Enter your secret message and passcode when prompted.

bash 🖥️ How It Works
The program reads the image using cv2.imread.

The message is embedded pixel-by-pixel into the RGB channels.

A password is required to encrypt and decrypt the message.

The encrypted image is saved as encryptedImage.jpg.

Decryption works only with the correct passcode.

⚠️ Important Notes
Ensure that mypic.jpg exists in the same directory as stego.py.

If the image is missing or the path is incorrect, you will get a NoneType error.

Keep the secret message short relative to the image size (very large messages can cause errors).
