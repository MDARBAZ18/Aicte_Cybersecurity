# AICTE Cybersecurity Project

## Overview
This project focuses on various aspects of **Cybersecurity**, covering essential topics like **Steganography**, **Phishing Attacks**, **Cloud Security**, **Firewalls**, **Network Security**, and **Cryptography**. Additionally, we explore how Python libraries can be used to implement and learn about these security concepts. The project aims to provide a hands-on understanding of these critical cybersecurity domains.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **Steganography**
Steganography is the art of hiding information in plain sight, often within digital media like images, audio, and video files. It provides a layer of security by making the hidden message undetectable without knowledge of the secret. This project demonstrates how to encode a message within an image and decrypt it using a passcode, ensuring the confidentiality of the data.

### 2. **Phishing Attacks**
Phishing attacks are a form of cybercrime where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, personal details, or financial information. This section discusses the methods attackers use, how to identify phishing attempts, and preventive measures to avoid falling victim to such attacks.

### 3. **Cloud Security**
Cloud Security refers to the protection of data, applications, and services that are hosted in the cloud. The project covers essential cloud security concepts, including data encryption, identity and access management (IAM), secure APIs, and disaster recovery. We discuss the importance of securing cloud environments to protect sensitive data from cyber threats.

### 4. **Firewalls**
Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. This section covers the types of firewalls (hardware and software), their role in preventing unauthorized access to networks, and how they contribute to overall cybersecurity.

### 5. **Network Security**
Network Security involves the practices and tools used to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and resources in a network. This section explains various types of network attacks (e.g., DDoS, MITM), and introduces tools and techniques for securing networks, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).

### 6. **Cryptography**
Cryptography is the practice of securing communication by converting plaintext into unreadable ciphertext. This section explores symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, digital signatures, and hashing techniques. It also discusses the importance of cryptography in protecting data privacy and ensuring secure communication.

### 7. **Python Libraries for Cybersecurity**
Python offers several libraries that make it easier to implement cybersecurity measures. This section covers popular libraries such as:
- **PyCrypto**: For cryptographic operations.
- **Scapy**: For network security and packet manipulation.
- **Requests**: For making secure HTTP requests and handling SSL/TLS.
- **OpenCV**: For image-based steganography.
These libraries are essential for anyone learning or working in the field of cybersecurity.
